# Fill-in-the-Blanks Quick Start Guide

## Step 1: Run Database Migration

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/syket/SD/client-projects/studious/studious-web

# Connect to your database and run the migration
# Option A: Using psql command line
psql -h your-host -U your-user -d your-db -f migrations/004_add_fill_in_blanks_question_types.sql

# Option B: Using Supabase dashboard
# 1. Go to SQL Editor in Supabase dashboard
# 2. Copy content from migrations/004_add_fill_in_blanks_question_types.sql
# 3. Paste and run

# Option C: Using npm run command (if you have a migration script)
npm run migrate:up
```

## Step 2: Verify Migration

Open your database and verify the new question types exist:

```sql
SELECT id, display_name, ui_component, section_id
FROM question_types
WHERE id LIKE '%fib%'
ORDER BY id;
```

Expected output:
```
pte-listening-fib-typing    | Fill in the Blanks - Type In       | pte-listening-fib-typing
pte-reading-fib-dragdrop    | Fill in the Blanks - Drag and Drop | pte-reading-fib-dragdrop
pte-reading-fib-dropdown    | Fill in the Blanks - Dropdown      | pte-reading-fib-dropdown
```

Check sample questions:
```sql
SELECT id, title, question_type_id
FROM questions
WHERE id LIKE 'sample-fib%';
```

## Step 3: Build & Run Application

```bash
# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Or build for production
npm run build
npm start

## Troubleshooting

### Question Types Not Showing

```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
npm run build
# Or restart dev server
```

**Check database:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM question_types WHERE id LIKE '%fib%';
```

### Blank Markers Not Detected

**Problem:** Blanks tab shows "No blanks detected"

**Solution:**
- Ensure using correct format: `{{blank_1}}`, `{{blank_2}}`, etc.
- Check for typos: double curly braces, lowercase "blank", underscore
- Make sure content is not empty

### Dropdown Shows No Options

**Problem:** Dropdowns appear but have no options

**Solution:**
1. Go to "Options" tab first
2. Add at least 4 options
3. Go to "Blanks" tab
4. Assign options to each blank
5. Set correct option

### Drag & Drop Not Working

**Problem:** Cannot drag words

**Solution:**
1. Check word bank has words (add words in Blanks tab)
2. Try different browser (HTML5 drag-drop support required)
3. On mobile, use touch events (touch and hold, then drag)

### Audio Not Playing

**Problem:** Audio player shows but won't play

**Solution:**
1. Verify audio file uploaded correctly
2. Check audio format (MP3 recommended)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify media URL is accessible
5. Check file size (should be < 50MB)

### Responses Not Saving

**Problem:** Answers disappear after navigation

**Solution:**

2. Verify API endpoints working
3. Check network tab for failed requests
4. Ensure onResponse callback is working
