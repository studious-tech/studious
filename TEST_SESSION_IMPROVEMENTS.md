## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Data Flow
```
User Interaction → State Update → Auto-Save → API Call → Database Storage
                   ↑                                    ↓
              Local State                       Confirmation

               UI Updates ← Response Data ← API Response
```

### 2. Component Architecture
```
TestSessionInterface (Main Container)
├── TestSessionHeader (Fixed Top Bar)
├── QuestionRenderer (Dynamic Question Loader)
│   └── Specific Question Components (MCQ, Text, Audio, etc.)
