# Build Error Fix - Summarize Spoken Text

## ❌ Error

```
Parsing ecmascript source code failed
./src/components/test-session/question-types/pte/listening/summarize-spoken-text.tsx (224:11)

> 224 |           return (
      |           ^^^^^^
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

Duplicate `return` statement on lines 223-224:

```tsx
return (
      return (  // ❌ Duplicate!
  <div className="min-h-[72vh] font-sans text-gray-900">
```

This was likely caused during the UI improvements when the code was being edited.

## ✅ Solution

Removed the duplicate `return` statement, keeping only one:

```tsx
return (
  <div className="min-h-[72vh] font-sans text-gray-900">
    <div className="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-8 py-6">
```

## 🎉 Status

**Build error fixed!** The component will now compile successfully.

## ⚠️ Remaining Lint Warnings (Non-Breaking)

These are just style warnings that won't prevent the build:

- `'onSubmit' is defined but never used` - Can be removed from props if not needed
- `Unexpected any. Specify a different type` - Can be typed properly later

The application should now build and run without errors! 🚀
